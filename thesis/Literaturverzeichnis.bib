@misc{Gaier.6152018,
	abstract = {Design optimization techniques are often used at the beginning of the design process to explore the space of possible designs. In these domains illumination algorithms, such as MAP-Elites, are promising alternatives to classic optimization algorithms because they produce diverse, high-quality solutions in a single run, instead of only a single near-optimal solution. Unfortunately, these algorithms currently require a large number of function evaluations, limiting their applicability. In this article we introduce a new illumination algorithm, Surrogate-Assisted Illumination (SAIL), that leverages surrogate modeling techniques to create a map of the design space according to user-defined features while minimizing the number of fitness evaluations. On a 2-dimensional airfoil optimization problem SAIL produces hundreds of diverse but high-performing designs with several orders of magnitude fewer evaluations than MAP-Elites or CMA-ES. We demonstrate that SAIL is also capable of producing maps of high-performing designs in realistic 3-dimensional aerodynamic tasks with an accurate flow simulation. Data-efficient design exploration with SAIL can help designers understand what is possible, beyond what is optimal, by considering more than pure objective-based optimization.},

@article{Lehman.2011,
	abstract = {In evolutionary computation, the fitness function normally measures progress toward an objective in the search space, effectively acting as an objective function. Through deception, such objective functions may actually prevent the objective from being reached. While methods exist to mitigate deception, they leave the underlying pathology untreated: Objective functions themselves may actively misdirect search toward dead ends. This paper proposes an approach to circumventing deception that also yields a new perspective on open-ended evolution. Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling natural evolution to capture open-endedness, the idea is to simply search for behavioral novelty. Even in an objective-based problem, such novelty search ignores the objective. Because many points in the search space collapse to a single behavior, the search for novelty is often feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behaviors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. By decoupling open-ended search from artificial life worlds, the search for novelty is applicable to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the maze navigation and biped walking tasks in this paper, novelty search significantly outperforms objective-based search, suggesting the strange conclusion that some problems are best solved by methods that ignore the objective. The main lesson is the inherent limitation of the objective-based paradigm and the unexploited opportunity to guide search through other means.},

@article{Meagher.1982,
	abstract = {A geometric modeling technique called Octree Encoding is presented. Arbitrary 3-D objects can be represented to any specified resolution in a hierarchical 8-ary tree structure or ``octree'' Objects may be concave or convex, have holes (including interior holes), consist of disjoint parts, and possess sculptured (i.e., ``free-form'') surfaces. The memory required for representation and manipulation is on the order of the surface area of the object. A complexity metric is proposed based on the number of nodes in an object's tree representation. Efficient (linear time) algorithms have been developed for the Boolean operations (union, intersection and difference), geometric operations (translation, scaling and rotation), N-dimensional interference detection, and display from any point in space with hidden surfaces removed. The algorithms require neither floating-point operations, integer multiplications, nor integer divisions. In addition, many independent sets of very simple calculations are typically generated, allowing implementation over many inexpensive high-bandwidth processors operating in parallel. Real time analysis and manipulation of highly complex situations thus becomes possible.},

@misc{Mouret.4202015,
	abstract = {Many fields use search algorithms, which automatically explore a search space to find high-performing solutions: chemists search through the space of molecules to discover new drugs; engineers search for stronger, cheaper, safer designs, scientists search for models that best explain data, etc. The goal of search algorithms has traditionally been to return the single highest-performing solution in a search space. Here we describe a new, fundamentally different type of algorithm that is more useful because it provides a holistic view of how high-performing solutions are distributed throughout a search space. It creates a map of high-performing solutions at each point in a space defined by dimensions of variation that a user gets to choose. This Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites) algorithm illuminates search spaces, allowing researchers to understand how interesting attributes of solutions combine to affect performance, either positively or, equally of interest, negatively. For example, a drug company may wish to understand how performance changes as the size of molecules and their cost-to-produce vary. MAP-Elites produces a large diversity of high-performing, yet qualitatively different solutions, which can be more helpful than a single, high-performing solution. Interestingly, because MAP-Elites explores more of the search space, it also tends to find a better overall solution than state-of-the-art search algorithms. We demonstrate the benefits of this new algorithm in three different problem domains ranging from producing modular neural networks to designing simulated and real soft robots. Because MAP- Elites (1) illuminates the relationship between performance and dimensions of interest in solutions, (2) returns a set of high-performing, yet diverse solutions, and (3) improves finding a single, best solution, it will advance science and engineering.},

@article{Preen.2016,
	abstract = {An initial study has recently been presented of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms used to design vertical-axis wind turbines wherein candidate prototypes are evaluated under fan-generated wind conditions after being physically instantiated by a 3D printer. Unlike other approaches, such as computational fluid dynamics simulations, no mathematical formulations were used and no model assumptions were made. This paper extends that work by exploring alternative surrogate modelling and evolutionary techniques. The accuracy of various modelling algorithms used to estimate the fitness of evaluated individuals from the initial experiments is compared. The effect of temporally windowing surrogate model training samples is explored. A surrogate-assisted approach based on an enhanced local search is introduced; and alternative coevolution collaboration schemes are examined.},

	abstract = {This thesis investigates shape deformation techniques for their use in design optimization tasks. In the first part, we introduce state-of-the-art deformation methods and evaluate them in a set of representative benchmarks. Based on these benchmarking results, we derive essential criteria and features a deformation technique should satisfy in order to be successfully applicable within design optimization. In the second part, we concentrate on the application and improvement of deformation techniques based on radial basis functions. We present and evaluate a unified framework for surface and volume mesh deformation and investigate questions of performance and scalability. In the final third part, we concentrate on the integration of additional constraints into the deformation, thereby improving the overall effectiveness of the design optimization process and fostering the creation of more feasible and producible design variations. We present a novel shape deformation technique that effectively maintains different types of geometric constraints such as planarity, circularity, or characteristic feature lines during deformation. At the same time, our method provides a unique level of modeling flexibility, quality, robustness, and scalability. Finally, we integrate techniques for automatic constraint detection directly into our deformation framework, thereby making our method more easily applicable within complex design optimization scenarios.},
